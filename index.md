[Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)](https://www.seai.ie) funded [project](https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-research/research-projects/details/building-upon-copernicus-earth-observation-services-to-augment-wind-measurement-coverage-of-the-oredp-offshore-renewable-energy-assessment-areas), whose objective is to design and implement a pilot service that provides regular generation of Irish offshore wind speed, direction, and power density estimates using Earth Observation (EO) data. The project started in June 2020 in the [School of Physics](https://www.ucd.ie/physics/) in [University College Dublin (UCD)](https://www.ucd.ie/). Associate Professor Sheila McBreen is the Principal Investigator. Dr. Derek O'Callaghan, previously Earth Observation Scientist for Parameter Space Ltd., is leading data processing and analysis. Professor Lorraine Hanlon, Director of the newly established UCD Centre for Space Research (C-SPACE), and Dr. Conor Sweeney from the UCD School of Mathematics and Statistics are also involved in the project.
