# Wind Atlas Development

Wind atlases provide energy resources maps containing information on wind speeds and related variables at multiple heights above sea level for (offshore) areas of interest (AOIs). Examples include:
* [SEAI Wind Atlas](https://www.seai.ie/technologies/seai-maps/wind-atlas-map/)
* [New European Wind Atlas](https://map.neweuropeanwindatlas.eu)

An interactive [wind atlas prototype](./MERA_ICS_Wind_Atlas) has been developed, involving scalable processing of the EOOffshore catalog as described in the [Offshore Wind in Irish Areas Of Interest](./Offshore_Wind_AOI) and [Comparison of Offshore Wind Speed Extrapolation and Power Density Estimation](./Comparison_Wind_Power) notebooks. The current implementation operates on the [EOOffshore MÃ‰RA data set](./MERA_ICS_Wind_Data) to demonstrate processing of high spatial resolution data. However, any of the [EOOffshore catalog](datasets) entries may also be used.
