Earth Observation Offshore
============================

[Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)](https://www.seai.ie) funded [project](https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-research/research-projects/details/building-upon-copernicus-earth-observation-services-to-augment-wind-measurement-coverage-of-the-oredp-offshore-renewable-energy-assessment-areas), whose objective is to design and implement a pilot service that provides regular generation of Irish offshore wind speed, direction, and power density estimates using Earth Observation (EO) data. The project started in June 2020 in the [School of Physics](https://www.ucd.ie/physics/) in [University College Dublin (UCD)](https://www.ucd.ie/). Associate Professor Sheila McBreen is the Principal Investigator. Dr. Derek O'Callaghan, previously Earth Observation Scientist for Parameter Space Ltd., is leading data processing and analysis.
